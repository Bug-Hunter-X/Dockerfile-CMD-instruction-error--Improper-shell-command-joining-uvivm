# Dockerfile CMD Instruction Error: Improper Shell Command Joining

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles when using the `CMD` instruction with multiple commands joined using `&&`.  The incorrect usage of `&&` within the `CMD` instruction can lead to the entire command failing to execute. 

## Bug
The provided `Dockerfile_bug.dockerfile` contains a faulty `CMD` instruction. The intention is to install project dependencies using `pip` and then run the main application. However, the `&&` operator is used incorrectly. The `CMD` instruction in Docker should be a single command, not a shell script. Therefore, the `&&` operator won't work as expected.

## Solution
The `Dockerfile_solution.dockerfile` demonstrates the correct approach to execute multiple commands. This is best accomplished using `ENTRYPOINT` for the main command and `CMD` to provide default arguments which are overwritten when you run docker. 

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1.  Clone this repository.
2. Build the image with the buggy Dockerfile: `docker build -f Dockerfile_bug.dockerfile -t buggy-image .`
3. Attempt to run the container: `docker run buggy-image`. Observe the failure.
4. Build the image with the corrected Dockerfile: `docker build -f Dockerfile_solution.dockerfile -t fixed-image .`
5. Run the corrected container: `docker run fixed-image`. Observe the successful execution.
